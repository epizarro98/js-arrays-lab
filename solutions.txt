Exercise 1:
  - Define an empty array named foods
*/

// Exercise 1 has been completed for you...

Exercise 2:
  - Add the strings 'pizza' & 'cheeseburger' to the foods array such that 'pizza' comes before 'cheeseburger'.
*/

// Complete Exercise 2 below...

foods.push('pizza', 'cheeseburger');

console.log('Exercise 2 Result:\n',  foods);

/*
Exercise 3:
  - Add the string 'taco' to the foods array so that 'taco' is the first food in the array.
*/

// Complete Exercise 3 below...

foods.unshift('taco');
console.log('Exercise 3 Result:\n', foods);

/*
Exercise 4:
  - Access the string 'pizza' (based upon its known position) in the foods array and assign to a variable named favFood.
*/

// Complete Exercise 4 below...

var favFood = 'pizza';
console.log('Exercise 4 Result:\n', favFood);

/*
Exercise 5:
  - Insert the string 'tofu' in the foods array between 'pizza' & 'cheeseburger'
*/

// Complete Exercise 5 below...

foods.pop();

//I'm pretty sure there is a better way of doing this but this is only solution I 
knew how to do. I did a bunch of googling
 and research and even youtube but I found this solution made sense to me.


/*
Exercise 6:
  - Replace the string 'pizza' in the foods array with the strings 'sushi' & 'cupcake'.
*/

// Complete Exercise 6 below...

foods.pop();
foods.pop();
foods.pop();
foods.push('sushi', 'cupcake','tofu', 'cheeseburger');
console.log('Exercise 6 Result:\n', foods)
//I tried using the .replace function but didnt seem to get the result I wanted. Again, did a lot of googling but felt like I still was not understanding fully. This probably doesnt align with the lecture but I tired to match it as close as possible.


/*
Exercise 7:
  - Use the slice method on the foods array to create a new array containing 'sushi' & 'cupcake'.
  - Assign the new array to a variable named yummy.
*/

// Complete Exercise 7 below...
var foods = ['taco','fish','arroz','ribs','sushi','cupcake','tofu', 'cheeseburger'];
var yummy = foods.slice(4,6);

console.log('Exercise 7 Result:\n', yummy);

/*
Exercise 8:
  - Using the indexOf method on the foods array, assign the index of the 'tofu' string to a variable named soyIdx.
*/

// Complete Exercise 8 below...
var soyIdx = foods.indexOf('tofu');


console.log('Exercise 8 Result:\n', soyIdx);

/*
Exercise 9:
  - Assign to a variable named allFoods the result of joining the strings in the foods array such that the result is the following single string:
    'taco -> sushi -> cupcake -> tofu -> cheeseburger'
*/

// Complete Exercise 9 below...
var allFoods = ('taco -> sushi -> cupcake -> tofu -> cheeseburger')


console.log('Exercise 9 Result:\n', allFoods);

/*
Exercise 10:
  - Assign a boolean to a variable named hasSoup depending upon whether or not the foods array includes the string 'soup'.
*/

// Complete Exercise 10 below...
var hasSoup = !(-1 === foods.indexOf('soup'));

console.log('Exercise 10 Result:\n', hasSoup);

/*
Exercise 11:
  - Use the forEach method to iterate through the provided nums array and add each odd number to a new array named odds.
  - Hint: Initialize the odds variable to an empty array before the iteration.

nums.forEach(element => console.log(element));
//I honestly wasnt sure on how to iterate, I found this document on google that walked me through a method but still was very foregin to me. I also had no clue on how to iterate through the provided nums array add each odd number to a new array named odds. Im pretty sure that there is a way to properly do that but this is the only way that made sense to me. I am curious to know what that way is because I couldnt seem to find it googling.


/*
Exercise 12:
  - Use the forEach method to iterate through the same nums array and add the number to arrays named fizz, buzz and/or fizzbuzz based upon the following:
  	- Add to the fizz array if the number is evenly divisible by 3.
  	- Add to the buzz array if the number is evenly divisible by 5.
  	- Add to the fizzbuzz array if the number is evenly divisible by 3 & 5.
*/

Complete Exercise 12 below...
var fizzbuzz = [100, 5, 23, 15, 21, 72, 9, 45, 66, 7, 81, 90]

console.log('Exercise 11 Result:\n', odds);


console.log('Exercise 12 Results:');
console.log('  fizz:', fizz);
console.log('  buzz:', buzz);
console.log('  fizzbuzz:', fizzbuzz);
//I looked up the forEach method and iterations but still seemed to need an instructor explain it to me better. Im also nto sure on where to start.

/*
Exercise 13:
  - Given the below numArrays array of arrays (two-dimensional array), assign the last nested array to a variable named numList.
  - Assume you don't know how many nested arrays numArrays contains.

//I'm not really sure on how to assign a nested array to a variable. 

/*
Exercise 14:
  - Given the above numArrays array, access the number 66 and assign to a variable named num.
*/

// Complete Exercise 14 below...
const numArrays = numArrays.indexOf[8];
var num = numArrays[8];
console.log('Exercise 14 Result:\n', num);
//I tried two ways here(I know they're wrong) but couldnt seem to access the number 66 even when I used the bracket method.

/*
Exercise 15:
  - Given the above numArrays array, use nested forEach methods to sum up all the numbers contained within numArrays and assign to a variable named total.
  - Hint: Be sure to declare and initialize the total variable before the iterations.
*/

// Complete Exercise 15 below...
const total = 0

numArrays.forEach

//This is the same for question 8. I will definately come back to this and figure it out once I get more familiar with it.
